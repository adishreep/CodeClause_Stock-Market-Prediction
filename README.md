# Stock-Market-Prediction

PROBLEM STATEMENT : Making trading decisions in the stock market without accurate predictions about the direction of stock prices can lead to significant financial risks for investors and financial institutions. To avoid potential losses, it is crucial to identify whether the stock price will be higher or lower than the current day's price. In order to tackle this challenge, a Python-based predictive model utilizing machine learning techniques is developed to forecast whether S&P 500's stock price will increase or decrease the following day.

Description: Dataset contains 10,843 rows and 8 columns. Thorough EDA has been done to understand data and identify patterns in it. Several algorithms have been fitted to get the best results and ensembling is applied to improve the performance of model.

Outcome: The model built using Gradient Boost ensembling obtained 0.68 precision score and 0.64 accuracy.

Technologies: Python, Data wrangling, Feature Engineering, Data Analytics, Predictive Modeling, Decision tree, Random forest, Ensemble methods.
